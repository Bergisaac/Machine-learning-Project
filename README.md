# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project uses machine learning to segment mall customers based on their spending behavior.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd mall-customer-segmentation
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Download Dataset:** Place `Mall_Customers.csv` in the project root. (e.g., from Kaggle)
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation.py
    ```

## Files

* `customer_segmentation.py`: Main Python script for data processing, clustering, and visualization.
* `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset (download separately).

## Usage

The script will:

* Load and preprocess the customer dataset.
* Perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.
* Visualize the clusters and customer characteristics.

## Key Libraries

* pandas: Data manipulation.
* scikit-learn: Machine learning (K-Means).
* matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
